# NFL_Match_Up_Scraper
Scrapes NFL team match up data from https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2019/games.htm.
The scraper will automatically scrape data from 2005 to 2019 if no arguments is changed. To change the range of years of data to access, change the parameter of the sortMatchUpdata in the main part of the code. The code will produce a csv file with all match up data in the year range.
A dataset containing data from 2005 to 2019 is attached to this repository.
